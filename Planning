Char select:
- Reckon you can view other player's char selection? 
- Countdown timer (30 sec?) to choose char
- "SELECT A CHARACTER"=title, grid of charss -> click on a char displays info/stats with "CONFIRM" button 
- "PLAY" button inactive until char has been selected, if player2 selects "PLAY" before player1 then display "Player 2 waiting..."

RAMBLING:
- New idea: countdown timer for a minute at each time that introduces a randomised "obstacle" that does damage to both players. 
  For example, the first can be a neutral enemy that deals damage to both of the players. Players have to attack enemy to get rid of it.
  Another example: randomly generated 'missiles' that come out of the sides so players have to move/jump or will take damage.
